#### Hi there 👋

My name is Alexandra, but you can call me Alex or Sasha. I’m about to begin my PhD at the University of Melbourne, where I’ll focus on the cosmic microwave background to study the early Universe.

Beyond research, I enjoy skateboarding, swimming, and filmmaking, and I’m always looking for new adventures.
